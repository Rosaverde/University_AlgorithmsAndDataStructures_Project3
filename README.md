# University_AlgorithmsAndDataStructures_Project3
Write a program that compares sort algorithms.\
\
Implement:\
\
-BubbleSort\
\
-BucketSort\
\
Load the data to be sorted from a text file or randomize. The program should work for real numbers in the range <0, 100>.\
\
Measure the runtime for different types (random data, sorted data, partially ordered data, data with an approximately uniform or not distributed distribution) and data sizes.
